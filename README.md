# ♟️ N-Queens Visualiser

🔗 **Live Demo:** [N-Queens Visualiser](n-queens-puzzle-phi.vercel.app)

This project is a web-based visualizer for the classic N-Queens problem. It allows users to explore all valid arrangements of N queens on an N×N chessboard where no two queens threaten each other, animated step-by-step.

## ✨ Features

- Input the number of queens (N) and visualize all possible solutions.
- Step-by-step backtracking animation to demonstrate how the algorithm works.
- Adjustable speed control via slider.
- Displays total number of valid arrangements.
- Simple, interactive, and user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open:** [index.html](https://guptavaibhav654.github.io/N-Queens-Puzzle/) in a modern browser.
2. **Input:** Number of queens (1 to 8).
3. **Adjust Speed:** Use the slider to set animation speed.
4. **Visualize:** Click "Play" to start solving and watch the algorithm in action.

## 🧠 Limitations

- Supports **N = 1 to 8** queens for performance and usability.
- Visualization might slow down for larger N due to computational complexity.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Font Awesome** (for queen icons and controls)

## ⚙️ How It Works

The visualizer uses a **recursive backtracking algorithm** to solve the N-Queens puzzle. It animates each decision point—showing placements and backtracking steps—by dynamically updating the board, allowing you to visually understand how the algorithm searches for solutions.
